## **SNAPDOG2 MEDIATOR REMOVAL - SESSION CONTEXT**
===========================================

CURRENT PHASE: Phase 3.2.5 - Final Integration Service Cleanup (Sprint 5-6)
CURRENT STEP: 3.2.5.1 - Restore remaining integration services and validate complete service architecture
LAST COMPLETED: Phase 3.2.4 - Successfully restored KNX integration service with direct service calls (KnxService)
NEXT OBJECTIVE: Complete integration service restoration and prepare for Phase 3.3 (complete mediator removal)

## **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

• **Files Modified**: 14+ (MQTT + KNX integrations restored and migrated)
• **Files Removed**: ~500+ (command/handler infrastructure)
• **Services Migrated**: ZonesController (✓), ClientsController (✓), MQTT Command Mapping (✓), KnxService (✓)
• **Tests Updated**: Integration patterns established for MQTT and KNX
• **Build Status**: ✅ PASS (0 errors, 20 warnings)

## **CRITICAL PATTERNS ESTABLISHED**

• **MQTT Migration Success**: ✅ CommandFactory calls successfully replaced with direct service injection
• **KNX Service Restored**: ✅ KnxService implemented with IZoneService/IClientService injection pattern
• **Integration Pattern**: ✅ Service-to-service communication working without mediator
• **Blueprint Validation**: ✅ CommandId attributes preserved throughout integration layer
• **Performance Improvement**: ✅ Direct calls showing expected performance gains

## **BLOCKERS/ISSUES**

• **GlobalStatusService Missing**: Still commented out in Program.cs, may be needed for system status
• **StatePublishingService**: May need integration with restored services
• **IntegrationServicesHostedService**: Needs validation with restored KNX/MQTT services
• **Remaining Integration Components**: Need to verify all integration services are properly restored

## **NEXT SESSION GOALS**

1. Primary: Restore GlobalStatusService and validate system status functionality
2. Secondary: Verify StatePublishingService integration with restored services
3. Validation: Ensure all integration services work together in new architecture
4. Preparation: Ready codebase for Phase 3.3 (complete mediator removal)

## **INTEGRATION RESTORATION STRATEGY**

```csharp
// Target: Complete integration service ecosystem restoration
// Pattern: Ensure all services use direct IZoneService/IClientService injection

// Files to investigate and restore:
// 1. Program.cs → uncomment GlobalStatusService if needed
// 2. StatePublishingService.cs → verify integration with restored services
// 3. IntegrationServicesHostedService.cs → validate service lifecycle
// 4. Check for any remaining disabled integration components

// Validation checklist:
// - All integration services registered in DI
// - No CommandFactory references remain
// - Services communicate via direct injection
// - System status reporting works
// - Integration lifecycle management functional
```

## **ARCHITECTURE INSIGHT**

Phases 3.2.3 and 3.2.4 successfully proved that both MQTT and KNX integrations can work with direct service calls while eliminating CommandFactory overhead. Now we need to ensure the complete integration ecosystem is restored and functioning, including system status services and lifecycle management.

## **RISK MITIGATION**

• **Git Rollback**: Clean commit state available at Phase 3.2.4 completion
• **Service Dependencies**: Verify all integration services have proper dependencies
• **Build Verification**: Run dotnet build after each restoration step
• **Integration Testing**: Validate service interactions work correctly
• **Status Monitoring**: Ensure system status reporting remains functional

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Continue with Phase 3.2.5 - Complete the integration service restoration by investigating and restoring any remaining integration components (GlobalStatusService, StatePublishingService integration, IntegrationServicesHostedService). Verify all services work together with the new direct service architecture and prepare for Phase 3.3 complete mediator removal.

This prompt completes the systematic integration restoration process, ensuring all integration services are properly restored and functioning before proceeding to the final mediator removal phase.
