- Strict Transport Security (HSTS) for HTTPS
- X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- Permissions Policy (formerly Feature Policy)
- Cross-Origin policies (COEP, COOP, CORP)
- Server information hiding
- Environment-aware CORS policies

### 6. Configuration Management ✅

**Enhanced:**

- `appsettings.json` - Complete configuration for all security features

**Features:**

- Environment-specific settings
- Rate limiting configuration
- Logging configuration
- Input validation settings
- Security header policies
- CORS policies

### 7. Middleware Pipeline Integration ✅

**Enhanced:**

## Configuration Examples

### Rate Limiting

```json
{
  "RateLimiting": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "DefaultRules": [
      { "Endpoint": "*", "Period": "1m", "Limit": 100 }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Request Logging

```json
{
  "RequestResponseLogging": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "LogRequestBody": true,
    "CorrelationIdHeader": "X-Correlation-ID"
  }
}
```

### Input Validation

```json
{
  "InputValidation": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "MaxBodySize": 1048576,
    "ValidateRequestBody": true
  }
}
```

## Middleware Pipeline Order

1. **Input Validation** - First line of defense against malicious input
2. **Request/Response Logging** - Captures all requests with correlation IDs
3. **Rate Limiting** - Prevents abuse after logging but before expensive operations
4. **Security Headers & CORS** - Sets security policies
5. **Authentication & Authorization** - Validates user access
6. **Routing & Controllers** - Application logic

## Testing Recommendations

### Rate Limiting Tests

- Verify 429 responses when limits exceeded
- Test rate limit headers presence
- Validate whitelist functionality
- Check endpoint-specific limits

### Logging Tests

- Verify correlation ID generation and propagation
- Test sensitive data redaction
- Validate request/response body logging
- Check performance timing accuracy

### Security Tests

- Test XSS protection effectiveness
- Validate SQL injection prevention
- Verify security headers presence
- Test CORS policy enforcement

### Authorization Tests

- Test resource ownership validation
- Verify role-based access control
- Test admin bypass functionality
- Validate dynamic policy creation

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Rate Limiting**: Adjust limits based on expected traffic patterns
2. **Logging**: Configure appropriate log levels and retention policies
3. **Security Headers**: Use strict CSP in production
4. **CORS**: Configure specific allowed origins for production
5. **SSL**: Ensure HTTPS is enabled for HSTS headers

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Monitor rate limit violations
- Track correlation IDs for request tracing
- Alert on security violations (XSS, SQL injection attempts)
- Monitor authorization failures
- Track performance metrics from logging middleware

## Compliance and Security Standards

This implementation addresses:

- OWASP Top 10 security risks
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Access control and authorization
- Secure headers and policies

All components are production-ready and follow security best practices.
