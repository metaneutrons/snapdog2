## Implementation Tracking Strategy

### 1. Progress Documentation Pattern

Create a standardized prompt template that includes:

SNAPDOG2 MEDIATOR REMOVAL - SESSION CONTEXT
===========================================

CURRENT PHASE: [Phase Name from implementation-plan.md]
CURRENT STEP: [Specific step number and description]
LAST COMPLETED: [What was just finished]
NEXT OBJECTIVE: [Immediate next task]

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:

- Files Modified: [count]
- Files Removed: [count]
- Services Migrated: [list]
- Tests Updated: [count]
- Build Status: [PASS/FAIL with errors]

CRITICAL PATTERNS ESTABLISHED:

- LoggerMessage: [status of conversion]
- Service Injection: [direct vs mediator calls]
- StateStore Events: [event flow working]
- Attribute Migration: [CommandId/StatusId status]

BLOCKERS/ISSUES:

- [Any current compilation errors]
- [Missing dependencies]
- [Test failures]

NEXT SESSION GOALS:

1. [Immediate next step]
2. [Following step if time permits]
3. [Validation/testing needed]

### 2. MCP Graph Integration

Use the Memento MCP to track:

Entities to Create:
• SnapDog2_Implementation_Progress - Overall status
• Mediator_Removal_Phase_[N] - Each phase status
• Service_Migration_[ServiceName] - Individual service progress
• Build_Issues_Log - Compilation problems and solutions

Relations to Track:
• depends_on - Service dependencies
• blocks - What's preventing next steps
• completed - Finished components
• validates - Testing relationships

### 3. Session Workflow

Session Start:

1. Read MCP graph for current state
2. Load implementation-plan.md
3. Generate context prompt with current status
4. Identify next 1-3 actionable steps

During Implementation:

1. Update MCP graph after each major change
2. Document patterns/solutions as they emerge
3. Track build status and error patterns
4. Note any deviations from plan

Session End:

1. Update progress entities in MCP
2. Document any new patterns discovered
3. Set clear next session objectives
4. Commit working state to git

### 4. Validation Checkpoints

After each service migration:
• Build verification: dotnet build --verbosity quiet
• Test status check
• Performance baseline (if applicable)
• Update progress tracking

### 5. Context Recovery Commands

Standard commands to quickly restore context:
bash

# Quick status check

semantic_search("SnapDog2 current implementation status")

# Get last session progress

open_nodes(["SnapDog2_Implementation_Progress"])

# Check for known issues

semantic_search("compilation errors solutions")

This approach ensures you never lose track of where you are in the complex mediator removal process, can quickly resume after breaks, and
maintain the architectural integrity established in your analysis.
