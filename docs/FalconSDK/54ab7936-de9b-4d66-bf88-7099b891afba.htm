This chapter explains what is needed to work with Falcon SDK

Any development environment suitable for producing code for .NET
Framework 4.8 (or higher) and/or .NET 6 (or higher) can be used. This
includes:

- An IDE like Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (or higher)

- An arbitrary code editor (from Notepad to Microsoft Visual Studio
  Code) plus a .NET Framework SDK or .NET 6 SDK for the necessary tools

All .NET programming languages are supported; examples in this
documentation are given in C# and VB only.

If there is a choice, we recommend using C# 8.0 or higher as this make
using some of the features in Falcon very easy.

Hint on using C# 8 with .NET Framework and Visual Studio (this is not
necessary with .NET 6):

- To specify C# 8.0, you may need to manually edit the project (csproj)
  file: add the line
  <span class="code">&lt;LangVersion&gt;8.0&lt;/LangVersion&gt;</span>
  to the first PropertyGroup (where also TargetFrameworkVersion is
  specified).

- Add the nuget package Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces

Falcon SDK is compatible with the following runtime environments and
platforms

- .NET Framework 4.8 or higher (Windows)

- .NET 6 (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS)

Depending on the platform and underlying hardware, some features may not
be available. E.g. USB support is currently limited to Windows and
Linux.

To actually access the KNX bus, some interface hardware is required.

- For the KNX medium "IP", access is provided by the network interface
  of the device Falcon is running on. As the KNXnet/IP routing protocol
  is based on IP multicast, a suitable network infrastructure (e.g.
  network routers supporting IGMP) is required.

- KNX USB interfaces are available for KNX media "TP", "RF" and "PL".
  These are connected via an USB cable to the device Falcon is running
  on.

- For the KNX medium "TP", IP Tunneling interfaces are available (often
  combined with KNX IP Routers). These are connected via an IP network
  to the device Falcon is running on.
