This is the first release of the new Falcon 6 generation. Compared to
Falcon 5, a lot of things have changed. Here is just a quick overview:

- General

  - Everything is now <span class="media">![External

    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/async"

  - KNX Stack according to KNX Handbook (with some small, motivated
    deviations)

  - Renamed several types and members to be in line with the KNX
    Handbook, and to correct spelling errors

  - Uses less resources (mainly threads)

- Diagnostics

  - Revised exceptions with clearer differentiation of causes in
    important error cases (e.g. IP connect failure)

  - Diagnostic information from everything (per top-level API call) is
    collected and included in exceptions

  - Statistics is collected by some important objects (e.g. number of TL
    repetitions, ...) and included in exceptions

- Security and Robustness

  - Much more thorough validation of incoming KNX and KNXnet/IP frames

  - Further reduced the chance that parts of a key or password is left
    as plain text in memory

- Network Procedures

  - Can now specify the default HopCount for all network functions

  - Fast scan on IP via SEARCH\_REQUEST

  - Moved
    [IsIndividualAddressFreeAsync](e4a9339c-519e-d96d-85d2-ad582c575d6c.htm)
    to Bus object (because it modifies the Interface temporarily)

- Device Management

  - Moved reconnect from TL to AL

  - Fail fast connect does not repeat initial DeviceDescriptorRead

  - Integrated MaxApduLength Negotiation

- USB Connector

  - Only one implementation for all OS

  - Added AutoReconnect (like for Tunneling)

  - Removed HID serial number as it is not supported by most devices
    anyway

  - Support for RF Multi interfaces

  - Support for KNX serial number in connection string

- Deployment

  - No more Autofac dependency

  - Simplified deployment: everything in one assembly Knx.Falcon.dll
    plus the appropriate SDK assembly.

- Utilities, Samples, Help

  - Extended [Datapoint Type (DPT)
    Converters](fb3cf115-c09e-4dc4-8782-69654a7ac5e3.htm#DPT)

  - New Console and WPF samples

Falcon 6 also offers some completely new functionality:

- Support for RF Multi

- New [Property Data Type (PDT)
  Converters](fb3cf115-c09e-4dc4-8782-69654a7ac5e3.htm#PDT)
